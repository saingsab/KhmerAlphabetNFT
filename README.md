# KhmerAlphabetNFT
### Introducing #Khmer_Alphabetâ€™s first-ever #NFT collection

Khmer Alphabet is a collection of 122 randomly generated and stylistically curated NFTs that exist on the Polygon Blockchain.

Khmer Alphabet holders can participate in exclusive events such as NFT claims, raffles, community giveaways, and more. Remember, all Alphabet are cool, but some are cooler than others.

You can do anything like flipping or whatever. The fund from this collection will use for my next project Learn To Earn (L2E) launching.

Rewards will drop to all participants and as well as a learner you will earn while you educate yourself about blockchain and cryptocurrency. 

 For  NFT collections holders will get a native token of the project that will represent as governance token with full authority and you will use this right to vote for the decision of the direction of the platform.
